<h1>INTRODUCTION TO C</h1>

<p>C is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop 
the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C, now known as the K&R standard.
The UNIX operating system, the C compiler, and essentially all UNIX application programs have been written in C.
 C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons</p>
 
 <ul>
 
 <li> Easy to learn</li><br/>
 <li> Structured language</li><br/>
 <li> It produces efficient programs</li><br/>
 <li> It can handle low-level activities</li><br/>
 <li>It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms</li><br/>
 
 </ul>



<h3>FACTS ABOUT C</h3>

<ul>

<li> C was invented to write an operating system called UNIX.</li><br/>
<li> C is a successor of B language which was introduced around the early 1970s.</li><br/>
<li> The language was formalized in 1988 by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).</li><br/>
<li> The UNIX OS was totally written in C.</li><br/>
<li> Today C is the most widely used and popular System Programming Language.</li><br/>
<li> Most of the state-of-the-art software have been implemented using C.</li><br/>
<li> Today's most popular Linux OS and RDBMS MySQL have been written in C.</li><br/>

</ul>


<h3>WHY USE C?</h3>

<p>C was initially used for system development work, particularly the programs that make-up the operating system.
 C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast as the code written in 
 assembly language. Some examples of the use of C might be</p>
 
 <ul>
 
 <li> Operating Systems</li><br/>
 <li> Language Compilers</li><br/>
 <li> Assemblers</li><br/>
 <li> Assemblers</li><br/>
 <li> Text Editors</li><br/>
 <li> Print Spoolers</li><br/>
 <li> Network Drivers</li><br/>
 <li> Modern Programs</li><br/>
 <li> Databases</li><br/>
 <li> Language Interpreters</li><br/>
 <li> Utilities</li><br/>
 
 </ul>
